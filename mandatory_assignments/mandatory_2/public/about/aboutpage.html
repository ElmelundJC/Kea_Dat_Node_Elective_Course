<h2>About me</h2>



<p id="about-p-tag">Detail and solution oriented student, that loves to dive into the world of computer science. If I encounter a problem on my way, I set it as a goal to find the best solution. <br>
    I'm a student at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology) training to become an AP graduate in computer science and currently im at my fourth semester. <br>
    <br>
    In the first semester of my education i became a dad, to a boy that is now 1,5 year old, which is why my focus has been on my family and my education. <br>
    The role as a father, and the experience i have gotten from both work and other studies, has tought me a lot about communication and time management. These are only a few skills i bring with me to my future work.
