    <h3>Understanding why we need to serve static files and how to do it in Express</h3>
    <p>As explained in the sixth week, the importance of serving files static is major. Since html, css, javaScript and image files are static they cannot arrive to the clients browser unless we define it. Therefor we assign a folder with the static module.</p>

    <p>If it hasnt been mentioned, defining this static folder in our directory folder also lets us send subfolders inside the static folder.</p>

        <h3>jQuery Basics - Understanding the library</h3>
        <p>JQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that is designed to ease and shorten your code. JQuery wraps several lines of JavaScript code together as methods, which you then can call with fewer lines of code. Often JQuery is used together with another tool like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), and JSON</p>
        <p>Constains features like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
            <li>CSS manipulation</li>
            <li>HTML event methods</li>
            <li>Effects and animations</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The way we implement the Jquery library is either download the library and make a reference in the header of an html file or link the address to an online library, also in the header of the html file</p>
