    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>const: A constant variable that is immutable</li>
        <li>let: A mutable variable (Better and newer version than var)</li>
        <li>var: A mutable variable, but behaves different than let.(Stop using var!)</li>
        <li><span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables">MDN - for more information</a></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Strict Mode</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Definded befor use with: "use strict;" or "use strict";</li>
        <li>Makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics... </li>
        <li><span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">MDN - for more information</a></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Scopes is what is defined inside { }</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Type Coercion</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers)</li>
        <dd>
            <br> 
            Example: <br>
            <span>const value1 = '5'; <br>
            const value2 = 9; <br>
            let sum = value1 + value2; <br>
            <br> 
            console.log(sum); --> 59 </span><br>
            <br>
        </dd>
        <li> As seen in the example above javaScript has coerced the 9 from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together. <br></li>
        <br>
        <dd><span>sum = Number(value1) + value2</span></dd>
        <br>
        <li>Therefor use the method Number() to convert the string value into a number.</li>

    <h3>Node Package Manager - npm</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Npm is two things:</p>
        <li>First and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects</li>
        <li>Second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.</li>

        <p>A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day. These applications can be searched for on https://www.npmjs.com/. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single command-line command.
        <br>
        Let's say you're hard at work one day, developing the Next Great Application. You come across a problem, and you decide that it's time to use that cool library you keep hearing about - let's use Caolan McMahon's async as an example. Thankfully, npm is very simple to use: you only have to run npm install async, and the specified module will be installed in the current directory under ./node_modules/. Once installed to your node_modules folder, you'll be able to use require() on them just like they were built-ins.</p>
        <li><span><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/">nodejs.org - for more information</a></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Express</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Express is one of the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:</p>
        <li>Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).</li>
        <li>Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.</li>
        <li>Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.</li>
        <li>Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.</li>
        <li><span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction">MDN</a> or <a href="https://expressjs.com/">expressjs.com</a></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nodemon</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

        nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.</p>
    </ul>
